title: I moved my blog

I moved my blog. Or more accurately, I am continuing my blog here, using
[Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). After 8 or whatever years, I got fed up
of typing text into a browser -- who knew it would take so long? This post is
actually typed with Markdown, and I get syntax highlighting for free too.

~~~ {.python}
for i in xrange(20):
  print 'Rejoice!'

You can check out my previous blog at
[http://unpythonic.blogspot.com/](http://unpythonic.blogspot.com/)
-- cool address, I know, sad to lose it, but did I mention I was typing code into
a `<textarea>`{.html}?
