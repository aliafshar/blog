title: The British Scale of Excellence

As a Brit in California, I sometimes have trouble expressing myself or being understood. I've decided to publish my scale as a reference guide for those who might find it useful.

| `en_US` | `en_GB` |
|---------|---------|
| Very bad | Not entirely terrible |
| Bad | Not too bad |
| OK  | Not too bad at all |
| Good | Not bad |
| Very Good | Not too shabby |

I hope that helps.
