    <title>Building a Haskell web app with Snap</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m a Haskell newbie, and it’s fun. I thought I’d document my adventures. Starting with my attempt to build a web app. I could have spent months picking a web framework. There are decent comparisons on the web. I picked <a href="http://snapframework.com">Snap</a>, because of the name (and perhaps some advice from a geeky friend of mine). I’ve written web frameworks (in Python) and the intro to Snap caught my eye. All pretty arbitrary reasons, so let’s get started.</p>
<p>First there is a quickstart guide. Great, who doesn’t love quickstart guides? It tells me how to install the framework, though that redirects me to another page, but I don’t mind. I would have to have Cabal installed, otherwise it wouldn’t work. Instead of just plain:</p>
<pre><code>cabal install snap</code></pre>
<p>I do:</p>
<pre><code>cabal install --user --prefix=$HOME snap</code></pre>
<p>Which seems the most convenient way to put things in my ~ tree rather than anywhere on the system. Great it works first time with no dependency issues, conflicts, or compile errors. That’s pretty rare, so great start!</p>
<p>I start to follow the quickstart guide. First create a directory, then call:</p>
<pre><code>snap init barebones</code></pre>
<p>This is great too, so we have a utility script to perform basic operations (as any decent web framework should), and by the look of “barebones” it seems that there are multiple possible templates to start from. Another great feature. The guide suggests running</p>
<pre><code>snap init -h</code></pre>
<p>To see the list of templates, and here they are:</p>
<pre><code>snap init [type]

    [type] can be one of:
    default   - A default project using snaplets and heist
    barebones - A barebones project with minimal dependencies
    tutorial  - The literate Haskell tutorial project</code></pre>
<p>So three starter templates, one of which is a tutorial. So, two starter templates: “barebones” and “default”. I guess we will use default in the future when writing a real app, with Snaplets. I won’t have much cause to write my own templates, I hope, so moving on.</p>
<p>The guide doesn’t explain much what it created, but my tree looks like this now:</p>
<pre><code>./log
./log/access.log
./snaptest.cabal
./src
./src/Main.hs
./.ghci</code></pre>
<p>Pretty much nothing there except Main.hs, which looks like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}</span>
<span class="kw">module</span> <span class="dt">Main</span> <span class="kw">where</span>

<span class="kw">import</span>           Control.Applicative
<span class="kw">import</span>           Snap.Core
<span class="kw">import</span>           Snap.Util.FileServe
<span class="kw">import</span>           Snap.Http.Server

<span class="ot">main ::</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> ()
main <span class="fu">=</span> quickHttpServe site

<span class="ot">site ::</span> <span class="dt">Snap</span> ()
site <span class="fu">=</span>
    ifTop (writeBS <span class="st">&quot;hello world&quot;</span>) <span class="fu">&lt;|&gt;</span>
    route [ (<span class="st">&quot;foo&quot;</span>, writeBS <span class="st">&quot;bar&quot;</span>)
          , (<span class="st">&quot;echo/:echoparam&quot;</span>, echoHandler)
          ] <span class="fu">&lt;|&gt;</span>
    dir <span class="st">&quot;static&quot;</span> (serveDirectory <span class="st">&quot;.&quot;</span>)

<span class="ot">echoHandler ::</span> <span class="dt">Snap</span> ()
echoHandler <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
    param <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> getParam <span class="st">&quot;echoparam&quot;</span>
    maybe (writeBS <span class="st">&quot;must specify echo/param in URL&quot;</span>)
          writeBS param</code></pre>
<p>It reads nicely, don’t you think?</p>
<ul>
<li>Some imports</li>
<li>A main function that serves the site</li>
<li>A site function that returns some Snap, Snap looking like a monad. This is the part that I don’t exactly get: &lt;|&gt; anyone?. We are obviously defining routes, and I am guessing there are 3 ways of hitting this site (This is possibly a bit too much information for a quickstart, I might be happier with just the echo handler, but maybe that isn’t possible on its own. Doesn’t matter though):</li>
<li><code>/</code> – (ifTop, I’m guessing for the root) where we just return “hello world”</li>
<li><code>/foo</code> – which just returns “bar”</li>
<li><code>/echo/&lt;something&gt;</code> – which echoes the something back at us</li>
<li>The echo handler itself, which gets the parameter defined in the route and returns it. Not exactly sure what the maybe line is doing here. I guess it is a failure condition, though I am more used to frameworks where a missing echoparam would not match the route and just 404.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the snap utility created a cabal file for us (how convenient), I can just install the app with:</p>
<pre><code>cabal install --user --prefix=$HOME</code></pre>
<p>That’s right, my app is an executable, now installed, which I can just run. That’s pretty awesome, we don’t have stuff like that in Python frameworks. I had called my initial directory snaptest and that is how the executable comes out. Let’s run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ snaptest -p 8000
Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8000/</code></pre>
<p>And here is what we get:</p>
<pre><code>http://localhost:8000/
hello world

http://localhost:8000/foo
bar

http://localhost:8000/echo
No handler accepted echo

http://localhost:8000/echo/banana
banana</code></pre>
<p>Great, as we mostly imagined, except I can’t make the maybe condition in the echo handler happen, but I don’t care much either. After maybe 256 seconds of actual effort and 16 minutes after deciding to write a Haskell web app, I have one.</p>
<p>This is the best quick start experience I have had for any web application framework in any language, so things bode well for the future.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Python’s collections module has some of the most consistently useful collection data structures you will need for everyday programming. Here’s one I didn’t know about, <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter">collections.Counter</a> (Python 2.7 only!). It is designed to keep “tallies” or count instances of something. The example will make it all clear:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="ch">from</span> collections <span class="ch">import</span> Counter
cars = Counter()
<span class="co"># I see one go past, it is red</span>
cars[<span class="st">&#39;red&#39;</span>] += <span class="dv">1</span>
<span class="co"># And a green one</span>
cars[<span class="st">&#39;blue&#39;</span>] += <span class="dv">1</span>
<span class="co"># etc</span></code></pre>
<p>This is pretty much like a defaultdict with an integer value, but it is convenient and neat, with a useful constructor.</p>
<p>There’s more. “Are two strings anagrams?”</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">are_anagrams = <span class="kw">lambda</span> s1, s2: Counter(s1) == Counter(s2)</code></pre>

    <title>Watching a file system directory with inotify and Linux</title>

<p>“Inotify is a Linux kernel subsystem that acts to extend filesystems to notice changes to the filesystem, and report those changes to applications.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify">[Citation Needed]</a></p>
<p>You can use this service from Python using <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a> to watch a directory and its contents. Twisted is perfect for this as you likely want to be doing a number of other things at the same time, for example, making an HTTP request every time a change is noticed. The code is so monstrously simple, I will just paste it below.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="ch">from</span> twisted.internet <span class="ch">import</span> inotify
<span class="ch">from</span> twisted.python <span class="ch">import</span> filepath

<span class="kw">class</span> FileSystemWatcher(<span class="dt">object</span>):

  <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="ot">__init__</span>(<span class="ot">self</span>, path_to_watch):
    <span class="ot">self</span>.path = path_to_watch

  <span class="kw">def</span> Start(<span class="ot">self</span>):
    notifier = inotify.INotify()
    notifier.startReading()
    notifier.watch(filepath.FilePath(<span class="ot">self</span>.path),
                   callbacks=[<span class="ot">self</span>.OnChange])

  <span class="kw">def</span> OnChange(<span class="ot">self</span>, watch, path, mask):
    <span class="kw">print</span> path, <span class="st">&#39;changed&#39;</span> <span class="co"># or do something else!</span>

<span class="kw">if</span> <span class="dt">__name__</span> == <span class="st">&#39;__main__&#39;</span>:
  <span class="ch">from</span> twisted.internet <span class="ch">import</span> reactor
  fs = FileSystemWatcher(<span class="st">&#39;/home/ali/tmp&#39;</span>)
  fs.Start()
  reactor.run()</code></pre>
<p>Incredibly easy, and another example of how awesome Twisted is.</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Calling the Google Drive API and other Google APIs asynchronously with Twisted</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may know that the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/">Google API Python Client</a> is built on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/httplib2/">httplib2</a>. This is a reasonable general choice, but the tight coupling is unhelpful in situations where a different HTTP library, or an entirely different approach to network programming should be used. An example of this is <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a>.</p>
<p>I won’t be going on about how awesome Twisted is, but let’s just take it for granted that it is so awesome that I could not write this particular application without it.</p>
<p>Httplib2 is blocking, and that makes it incompatible with being run inside the Twisted reactor. Fortunately we are only the latest person to have this problem, and a solution exists, <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.threads.deferToThread.html">twisted.internet.threads.deferToThread</a>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">api_call = drive.files().<span class="dt">list</span>()

<span class="kw">def</span> on_list(resp):
  <span class="kw">for</span> item in resp[<span class="st">&#39;items&#39;</span>]:
    <span class="kw">print</span> item[<span class="st">&#39;title&#39;</span>]

d = deferToThread(api_call.execute)
d.addCallback(on_list)</code></pre>
<p>A blocking call will be made in a thread and will callback on the returned deferred when it is done. I appreciate that no one<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> is 100% happy with this solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Argh, threads!”, “Argh, async!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is a testament to the Greatness of Twisted that it has this sort of facility to play well with other, less flexible, systems.</p>
